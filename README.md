# QuadDamageDrop
This mod introduces droppable quad damage in quake 

In vanilla quake many maps have a quad damage powerup that gives players who collect it 4x damage for 30 seconds or until they are killed.  The powerup doesn't persist after death


This mod of quake makes the quad damage powerup drop along with the other items the player has.  Now if a player with quad damage dies a quad-damage 'Q' item drops in addtion to the normal backpack which has only the remaining time left on it.  The 'Q' will vanish after the time is up.
